        <h1>History</h1>
        The campany Galuni-propeties was formed in the year 2019 and came
         into market in the year 2021 due to gorvernment land policies and struggles
          from envirnmental ministry.Our idea came in when we noticed that many people wanted to 
          own their lands others wanted to relocate from variouse places to go and experience new enviromental 
          friendly places,in the year 2022 we were able to open another branch located in the near border of Nairobi and Thika.
